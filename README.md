Tutor Me is an Online Tutoring Platform that was developed to address the issues facing both online tutors and tutees. With the plethora of different services there now exists for different online needs, more and more time is being spent during online tutoring sessions syncing across these technologies, eating into valuable learning time.

## The Problem
Let's look at this using an example, with our tutor Jayme, and tutee Mika, and what happens during a routine online tutoring session.

1. Mika arrives on time but has to wait for Jayme to start the Zoom call.
2. Jayme sends the Zoom invitation link using WhatsApp so Mika needs to send that from her phone to her PC.
3. The first portion of the session is spent recapping previously discussed points due to the lack of notes for Mika to reference and read.
4. Mika has forgotten that there is homework due today and Jayme has forgotten to mark and plan the homework.
5. Mika sends Jayme a picture of a Maths question but has to do it over Whatsapp
6. At the end of the session, Mika has to reschedule for next week, so they overrun when discussing the new time.

As you can see, there are a lot of problems here, and all of them waste valuable time that should be otherwise spent teaching and learning. This is where Tutor Me comes in.

## The Solution

Tutor Me provides an integrated experience for the entire tutoring process. Tutors and Tutees use the same platform for calling, chatting, scheduling meetings, note taking and homework assignments. Everything is now in one place, making it much easier to reference and keep track of tutoring needs. We have individual and group calling, real-time messaging, persistent note taking and an easy to use meeting booking system.
